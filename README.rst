# StreptoCAD

**StreptoCAD** is an open-source software toolbox designed to automate and streamline genome engineering in Streptomyces. This tool supports various CRISPR-based techniques and gene overexpression methods, significantly simplifying the genetic engineering process.

## Features

- **Automated Primer and Guide Sequence Design:** Automatically generates necessary DNA primers and guide sequences for your target genes.
- **Plasmid Assembly Simulation:** Simulates plasmid assemblies and the resulting genomic modifications.
- **Six Design Workflows:** Supports workflows including overexpression library construction, base-editing, and in-frame deletions using CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas3 systems.
- **FAIR Compliance:** Ensures data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, promoting reproducibility and ease of data management.
- **User-Friendly:** Suitable for both experienced users and beginners, facilitating collaboration and standardized workflows.

## Why StreptoCAD?

Streptomyces is a prolific source of novel bioactive molecules, but current genetic engineering methods are inefficient and time-consuming. StreptoCAD addresses these challenges by automating the design process, reducing errors, and speeding up the development of genetically modified strains. This tool transforms complex genetic engineering tasks into straightforward, reproducible processes, enabling faster scientific advancements and discovery of new natural products.

## Workflows

StreptoCAD offers six distinct workflows for various genetic engineering tasks:

1. **[Overexpression Plasmid Library Construction](#workflow-1-overexpression-plasmid-library-construction):**
   - Activates silent BGCs and enhances natural product yields using the pOEX-PkasO plasmid system.
2. **[Single CRISPR-BEST Plasmid Generation](#workflow-2-single-crispr-best-plasmid-generation):**

   - Introduces targeted point mutations in the genome of Streptomyces using single sgRNA targeting.

3. **[Multiplexed CRISPR-BEST Plasmid Generation](#workflow-3-multiplexed-crispr-best-plasmid-generation):**

   - Simultaneously targets up to 28 individual bases in the genome for high-throughput genetic studies.

4. **[CRISPRi Plasmid Generation](#workflow-4-crispri-plasmid-generation):**

   - Uses transcriptional interference to reversibly inactivate genes for functional studies.

5. **[In-frame Deletion with CRISPR-Cas9](#workflow-5-in-frame-deletion-with-crispr-cas9):**

   - Creates in-frame deletions using ssDNA bridging and Gibson cloning for functional gene knockouts.

6. **[In-frame Deletion with CRISPR-Cas3](#workflow-6-in-frame-deletion-with-crispr-cas3):**
   - Achieves in-frame deletions with higher efficiencies using Cas3 and a PCR/Gibson protocol.

## Experimental Validation

StreptoCAD's efficiency and user-friendliness were validated by designing and constructing 13 overexpression strains in Streptomyces coelicolor in just eight weeks. This highlights the tool's capability to accelerate genome engineering projects.

## Future Developments

Future expansions will include additional genome engineering tools and integration with laboratory robotics systems for end-to-end automation, further enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of StreptoCAD.
