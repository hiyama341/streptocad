        "Base-editing with CRISPR-BEST is a DSB-free method that uses a single sgRNA to target a specific genomic location with single-nucleotide–resolution(Figure 3A) which can enable in-vivo protein engineering or as it is often used, for introducing early stop-codons10,12. It can be used to introduce targeted point mutations in the genome of Streptomyces, facilitating studies on gene function and protein engineering. To get started quickly users can download the pCRISPR-cBEST plasmid file, the genome file for S.coelicor (A3) and streptoAIM will generate your plasmids based on the genes you chose to target (Figure 3, S5).
