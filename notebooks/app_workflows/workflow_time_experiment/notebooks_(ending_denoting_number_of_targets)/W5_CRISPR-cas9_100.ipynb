        "In Workflow 5, CRISPR-Cas9 combines ssDNA bridging and Gibson cloning to create in-frame deletions (Figure 6A). This ensures that the downstream genes are not disrupted, which is crucial for functional studies of gene knockouts. This workflow can be used to study gene function by knocking out specific genes in streptomycetes and observing the resulting phenotypic changes. It can also be used to create markerless deletions, which are important for constructing clean genetic backgrounds for further genetic manipulations. To get started, download the pCRISPR-Cas9 file and a genome file (e.g., S. coelicolor A3), then select the genes to delete. StreptoAIM will generate the necessary primers and plasmid constructs (S5).\n"
